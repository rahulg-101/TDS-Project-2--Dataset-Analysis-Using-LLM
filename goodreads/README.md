## 1. Introduction

The literary landscape is evolving, influenced by changing reader preferences, the emergence of new genres, and the proliferation of publication technologies. This dataset encompasses **10,000 rows** and **23 columns**, providing a diverse perspective on book identifiers, ratings, and market dynamics. Through a combination of numeric and categorical data, it offers insights into the relationships between book attributes, reader engagement, and historical publication trends.

### Data Overview

- **Dataset Composition**: It includes numeric columns associated with book identifiers, ratings, and counts, alongside categorical identifiers like ISBNs, authors, titles, and URLs. 
- **Data Quality Assessment**: While it reveals unique trends, it contains missing values particularly in ISBN entries, which may affect data integrity.

## 2. Key Patterns & Relationships

The analysis reveals significant relationships among various metrics:

### Primary Trends in the Data

- **Ratings Count vs. Average Rating**: A positive correlation between higher ratings and accumulated ratings count, suggesting that popular books consistently maintain quality.
- **Publication Year Trends**: Books published post-2000 tend to have higher average ratings, indicating current preferences favor contemporary literature.

### Notable Correlations

- **Average Ratings and Ratings Count**: A correlation of approximately **0.74** indicates that books with higher ratings receive more reviews.
- **Work Text Reviews vs. Average Ratings**: This positive trend suggests that robust reviews contribute to enhanced credibility and ratings.

## 3. Visual Analysis

### 3.1 Correlation Analysis

The correlation matrix illustrates strong relationships among key metrics:
- The correlation between `average_rating` and `ratings_count` stands at **0.74**, emphasizing that well-reviewed books accumulate attention.

### 3.2 Distribution Analysis

The distribution plots reveal:
- **Book Id Distribution**: Uniform representation across the dataset.
- **Goodreads & Best Book Ids**: Right-skewed distributions indicate a concentration of lower values, potentially highlighting underrepresentation of certain popular titles.

### 3.3 Time Series Analysis

        df[col] = np.where(df[col] < lower_bound, lower_bound, df[col])

    # Prepare data for regression analysis
    features = df[['books_count', 'average_rating', 'ratings_count']]
    target = df['work_ratings_count']
    
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    
    # Perform regression analysis
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=10, max_depth=5, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Prediction and performance evaluation
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)

    plt.xlabel('Feature Importance')
    plt.title('Feature Importance Analysis')
    plt.savefig('feature_importance_analysis.png')
    plt.close()
